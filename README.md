# PopularMoviesStageTwo
Popular Movies Stage Two completed for Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree

This Android application calls The Movie Database using their API key and shows you a grid of movies that you may sort by 
Popularity, User Rating, or Favorites. The Favorites allows you to see movies that you favorited and are stored in a SQL Database built using ROOM.
You can read abot the movie you select and see reviews and even trailers for the movie.

## Why this Project

To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular 
mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build 
clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, 
and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these 
fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the 
foundational elements of programming for Android. Your app will communicate with 
the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

## What I learned
- Fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API
- Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views
- Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
- Build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system.
